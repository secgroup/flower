# Services

### General idea

We create pcap of N minutes on the virtual machine. We somehow download them, and use the `importer.py` script to analyze and import them into mongodb. The webapp does rest request to the webservices, that does query to mongodb.

### MongoDB structure

We use a single collection for all the pcaps
Each document will have:

```{
        "inx": //progressive flow index inside pcap
        "time": //start timestamp
        "duration": //end_time-start_time
        "src_ip": "127.0.0.1",
        "src_port": 1234 ,
        "dst_ip": "127.0.0.1",
        "dst_port": 1234,
        "contains_flag": //true if the importer have found that the flow contains a flag based on the env var regex
        "starred": //if the flow is starred
        "flow": [
            {
                "data": "...", //printable data
                "hex": //original data encoded in hex
                "from": "c" // "c" for client, "s" for server
                "time": //timestamp
            },
            ...
        ],

    }

```

# Services description

All the end-points return an object or an array of objects.

##### POST /query

Accept the following payload

```
    {
       flow.data: "regex on data field of flow",
       dst_ip: "1.2.3.4"
       dst_port: "1.2.3.4"
       time : {"$gte": from_millis,
               "$lt": to_millis}
    }

```

It returns an array of documents, WITHOUT the "flow" field

##### GET /services

Returns informations about all services. It is configurable on `configurations.py`

##### GET /flow/(flow_id)

Returns the all document with `flow_id` id, including the field `flow`

##### GET /star/(flow_id)/(0,1)

Set the flow favourite (1) or not (0)

##### POST /starred

Returns a list of document like `/query` endpoint, but only with starred items.
