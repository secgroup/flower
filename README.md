## What is it?

![demo_image](https://github.com/secgroup/flower/blob/master/demo_images/demo3.png?raw=true)

Flower is an automatic packet analyzer made by Ca' Foscari University team for CyberChallenge attack/defense CTF held in Rome on the June 27th, 2018.

This tool was written in less than ten days, but it works! Every **contribution** is welcome!

Presentation of Flower (from min 7:30), and general introduction to CTFs at ESC2K18 in italian:

## Getting Started

### Run with docker

Clone the repo, enter in the directory, and just run `docker-compose up`, and after a while you will find flower at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For the flag regex, modify `REACT_APP_FLAG_REGEX` in `docker-compose.yml`.

The build will automatically import the test pcaps.

To enter in the service to import other pcaps, run `docker exec -it flower_flower-python_1 /bin/bash` (if flower is in a folder with a different name, modify the prefix after `-it`).
The container share the `/shared` folder with the host. Put the pcap files inside this folder and use `python services/importer.py /shared/pcap_file_here` from the container to import pcaps to flower.

### Manual installation

1. Clone and install dependencies
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/secgroup/flower
   cd flower
   npm install
   pip install -r services/requirements.txt
   ```
2. (Optional) Set the following environment variables:

- `REACT_APP_FLOWER_MONGO` ip of the host that will have flower db active (mongodb)
- `REACT_APP_FLOWER_SERVICES` ip of the host that will have services active
- `REACT_APP_FLAG_REGEX` regex that match flags.

3. Mongodb is required on the same machine that run the services.
   To start it: `sudo mongod --dbpath /path/to/mongodb/db --bind_ip 0.0.0.0`

#### Run

1. Start flower
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
2. Start flower services
   `bash cd services ./run_ws.sh `
   Once everything has been started, flower should be accessible at the address of the machine that started it on port 3000.

### Pcap import

You must first install pynids from [here](https://github.com/MITRECND/pynids). The pip version is outdated! Good luck with the installation.
Then, you can import pcaps into mongodb by executing the provided script `importer.py` as follows:

```
cd services
./importer.py pcap_file.pcap
```

You can find a test_pcap in `services/test_pcap`. For a quick demo, run `./importer.py test_pcap/dump-2018-06-27_13:25:31.pcap`

## Security tips (Important!)

If you are going to use flower in a CTF, remember to set up the firewall in the most appropriate way, as the current implementation does not use other security techniques.

> If you ignore this, everybody will be able to connect to your database and steal all your flags!
